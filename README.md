# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-C
Monte Carlo simulation with C

## Task:
Imagine you have 100 boxes numbered 1-100. You distribute 100 chips randomly into the boxes using a random number generator. That is, you pick a number from 1-100 from a uniform distribution and place a chip into that box. You keep picking random numbers until all the chips are exhausted. When the chips are exhausted you count the number of boxes that are empty, you count the number of boxes that have exactly one chip in them, you count the number of boxes with two chips, and so on.
The purpose of this simulation is to find out the expected number of empty boxes, the expected number of boxes with a single chip, the expected number of boxes with two chips, and so on, if the experiment were to be run only one time.
You are to run the experiment at least 10,0000 times and report the expected number of empty boxes, the expected number of boxes with a single chip, and so on. 

## Output: 
Expected number of boxes with chips: </br>
0 chip(s): 36.61 </br>
1 chip(s): 36.97 </br>
2 chip(s): 18.48 </br>
3 chip(s): 6.10 </br>
4 chip(s): 1.50 </br>
5 chip(s): 0.29 </br>
6 chip(s): 0.05 </br>
7 chip(s): 0.01 </br>
8 chip(s): 0.00 </br>
9 chip(s): 0.00 </br>
